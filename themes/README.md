# Jenkins Modern Theme Platform

The aim of this theme is to make Jenkisn much more usable. No theme that I find online has tried to address all the functionality as mentioned below. The primary features that I want to enable in this modern theme are:

- Dark Mode Supprt 
- Cleanup and use of modern icons 
- General theme improvents and close to [Blue Ocean](https://jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/about/)

**Note:** Though Blue Ocean is a good UI theme for most os the usecases it lacks the abiility to show useful packages like the promotion package, etc
