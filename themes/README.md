# [WIP] Jenkins Modern Theme Platform

**This theme is Work in Progress.**

The aim of this theme is to make Jenkins much more usable. No theme that I find online has tried to address all the functionality as mentioned below. The primary features that I want to enable in this modern theme are:

- Dark Mode Support 
- Cleanup and use of modern icons 
- General theme improvements and close to [Blue Ocean](https://jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/about/)

**Note:** Though Blue Ocean is a good UI theme for most os the use cases it lacks the ability to show useful packages like the promotion package, etc

# Editing theme 

```
npm run dev
```

# Building theme

```
